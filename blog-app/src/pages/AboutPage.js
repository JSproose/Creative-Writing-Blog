        <p>
            👋 Hi, I’m Jasper. I am an systems design engineering student passionate about understanding emotion and social interation
            through the lense of creative fiction. I began building my portfolio in high and have continued to write
            short, focussed, and often darkly comedic stories.
        </p>

        <br/>👀 I’m interested in the 3D modeling, animation, the VFX pipeline, graphics programming, and web development (React, Node, MongoDB, Express)
        <br/>🌱 I’m proficient in C++ (OpenGL, GTest, Qt), Javascript, Python, and 3D creation softwares (Blender, Fusion 360)
        <br/>💞️ I'm currently exploring ray marching and other real-time rendering techniques
