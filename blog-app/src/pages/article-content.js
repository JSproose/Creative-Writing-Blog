<strong>Not By Sight</strong>
</p>
<p>
My fingers were so numb I could hardly feel where the rock ended and bone began. The stone shard crumbled between the scales of the fish as I carved from tail to jaw. I ground away until a fine charcoal powder coated the perch, sparkling with the warmth of my dwindling fire. I bored my fingers deep into the perch’s flesh, undeterred by the icy nips of buried stone chunks at my frozen fingertips. I effortlessly peeled a layer from the Perch’s bones and staked it on the mossy point of a fallen tree branch. The tip of the fire tickled the fish as I twisted the branch back and forth. Any effort to stare hopelessly across the frozen floor of the island was diffused by the hypnotic stirring of the flames. My eyeballs shivered in their sockets. 
</p>
<p>
	My free hand struggled to close the torn cotton running down my clergy shirt. The tendons along the back of my hand were frozen taught, pulling my fingers upward and surrendering my palms to the wind. Frozen stubble dug into the thick of my neck as I curled my face into my clerical collar, which lay heavy on my shoulders with the weight of frozen sea water.
</p>
<p>
	I smelled the burnt sting of the perch’s skin before I noticed its blackened body. Dense gusts of frosty breath had obscured my view of the fish. I lifted the fish off the flames and patted the embers of its charred body along the perma frosted ground. Grandmother hadn’t let me become a scout, but I could still cook like one.

“Bless me, Father, for I have…I have…Well what have I done exactly…”
</p>
<p>
“Sinned,” I interjected.
</p>
<p>
“Sinned. Yes, of course, that’s it.  My God‒gosh. Okay, Lester, I’m gonna… I’m gonna go again.”
</p>
<p>
“Take your time.”
</p>
<p>
“In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen,” her voice crackled with age as her shriveled hands traced a cross along her chest. 
</p>
<p>
“Amen.”
</p>
<p>
“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been one day since my last confession. I am a wife and mother. I have belonged to this parish for-”
</p>
<p>
“Harriot–Mame…”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
“Were you here the day before yesterday?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course.”
</p>
<p>
“And the day before that?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not a perfect person, Father.”
</p>
<p>
“I remember the state of your life. There’s no need to repeat,” I smiled patiently.
</p>
<p>
“Yes‒well of course. Father, this is my sin. I promised Irene Woodley that I could bring a fish dish to next Sunday’s Potlatch for the young catholics heading to Mexico City on mission. Nothing specific, just fish. And well she can really keep a conversation moving, so we started discussing different kinds of fish. Nothing specific, just generally discussing fish. I mentioned Branzino. And, well Father, I mentioned it quite confidently. Father, I’m not even certain where I heard the word. You see, I only speak english. Anyways, I’ve been watching Shark Week, so maybe I heard Dr. O'Connell or that awful Tiffany Haddish mention it–”
</p>
<p>
“And you can’t make Branzino?” I swept in, stepping in front of her runaway ramble.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t. I lied. I’m sorry Father.”
</p>
<p>
I made an honest attempt at a somber nod. My chasuble stifled the wines of the stained teak bench as I shifted my weight onto my left hip, fishing through my robes for my phone. 
</p>
<p>
“Father, I am not a sinful person…I just…I just…”
</p>
<p>
“Do you have lemons?” I squinted over the wiry frame of my circular lenses as the blue light from my phone cut through the lattice screen of the confessional booth.
</p>
<p>
“Like metaphorically, Father?”
</p>
<p>
“No. It’s a recipe.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, of course. Yes I do. Is it baked… grilled… pan fried… broiled? I can only do so much at my age.” My wrinkled finger bounced off the cracks of the screen as I scanned for an answer.
</p>
<p>
“You know Harriet…” I began, navigating my pudgy fingers through the maze of advertisements closing in from the edges of the screen.
</p>
<p>
“Yes Father?”
</p>
<p>
“I think it is probably important to remind ourselves that this time is part of a relationship with God. In confession we not only share ourselves but we trust in God that venial sins will be ignored and that — you know, it doesn’t say but it looks pan fried.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh my God, because you are so good, I am very sorry that I have sinned against you; and I promise that with the help of your grace, I will not sin again. Amen.” Her recital of the verse was quiet yet musical, like a librarian's rallying cry. I assumed she didn’t want to waste the Lord’s time; and I agreed.
</p>
<p>
	“Amen,” I nodded my head and slipped my robes from beneath my thighs individually as I began to stand.
</p>
<p>
“Penance, Father?”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll just send you the link to the recipe and you’ll have to print it off.”
</p>

My teeth crashed through each dusty layer of the perch’s burnt skin, finding meat just as quickly as they found bone. I willed my tongue to lick my lips, but the cold forced it back into my mouth. I held close the warmest rolls of fat I had neglected in the mirror for a decade, tossing the mossy branch aside and lowering myself into a hole I had laboured over the entire morning. I could still make out the shoreline from within the hole if I tilted my head backwards and flared my nostrils —  like I was still fighting not to drown.
</p>
<p>
The shore was beautiful as it was unnervingly still. It seemed to stretch endlessly, a vanishing point on the canvas of the star spangled night sky. It had held up two greying arms to welcome not only a lone survivor but also the twirling shards of Aeromexico AM 617’s propellers and the eyeballs tugging bloated corpses in their wake. Of course it did not truly vanish into darkness. It curved and warped unnaturally to form the coast of the island, whose rocky terrain wore a flattop, speckled with the occasional stick dressed as a plant. The only exception to the despair was a tumorous collection of rocky shards that grew out over the shore, pairing the painterly night sky with a lopsided frame. The Lord’s brushwork had been sloppy.
</p>
<p>
	I wiggled my toes into the sides of the dirt coffin and spread my arms over the edges, hugging the mounds of dirt piled high around the edges of the pit. I sucked air over the cracked divots in my lips, let my chest collapse under the weight of the wind, and swept the dirt into the hole. I repeated the motion until the earth held me close, providing the little warmth it could spare. The wind imprinted my eyelashes in the loose skin pulled back against my forehead as I closed my eyelids. 
</p>
<p>
I only fell asleep once they were frozen shut.
</p>

</p>
<p>
Two shins hit the kneeler with a delicate puff, like his flesh could only barely weigh down his soul. His breath was calm, yet he took small sips like he was running out.
</p>
<p>
	“How are we today?”
</p>
<p>
	“Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.” His voice was shrill but still rattled like a tender old man was trapped just beneath his throat. “I have never confessed my Sins before God‒”
</p>
<p>
	“Son,” I cut in, taken back by the harshness of the silence I had created. “We, well… most people in my experience have started with a prayer.” He mumbled something soft that I missed over the hiss of my polyester robes. “How old are you?” His breath grew heavier and his shadow grew softer as he adjusted his knees and pulled his neon red belt a notch tighter. I caught a glimpse as he bobbed up and down; the red stood in cartoonish defiance of the rest of his church garb; a racing streak on a funeral Hearse. “It’s… um… it’s okay, I can start.”
</p>
<p>
	“In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. Amen,” he recalled, muttering the words with unexpected speed and keeping his eyes fixed on the shiny black tips of his church Consul’s.
</p>
<p>
	“Amen,” I agreed after a pause. “Son, what Sins have you come to confess,”
</p>
<p>
	“Ten.”
</p>
<p>
	“Pardon me?”
</p>
<p>
	“Last week, I turned ten years old.” I looked back towards the screen and caught a glimpse of two doughy brown eyes painted across a face that was pale and delicate like antique dishware.  “Aren’t you not supposed to look at me?” My eyes shifted elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
	“If you wish to be anonymous.”
</p>
<p>
“Father?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
	“Father, the thing is… I really need to talk with God,” His voice tightened and his shadow shrunk. I smiled with a smile that tugged at the fat of a single cheek, like I could understand his troubles and like I alone had the courage to solve them.
</p>
<p>
	“Of course, of course. Can you feel his presence?”
</p>
<p>
	“No. No, I don’t think I can. There are just some things I only want to share with Him. And then I’ll just ask some quick questions.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, I know I can feel him. And trust me, he is listening.”
</p>
<p>
	“They’re not mine, you know? The things I want to confess.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, okay… Well, you can only really confess your own sins.”
</p>
<p>
	“Father, I don’t sin.”
</p>
<p>
	“Every human has sinned… It’s kind of a big part of my job. Now, what are your<strong>‒</strong>”
</p>
<p>
	“Then when did you last sin, Father?”
</p>
<p>
	“C’mon now, I asked first.” I let out a gumless chuckle that was met with disinterest. “No I um… you cut me off a little…” I took a second glance through the screen and was immediately met by two beady eyes tucked under a furrowed brow. 
</p>
<p>
	“Please stop looking.” My eyes shot back to the worn wooden panes that wrapped around the interior of the booth. 
</p>
<p>
	“Yep, sorry.” I suspended a grin as I waited for the silence to dissipate, but all I heard was the low rattle of a lawn mower chain down some distant suburban avenue. My nose itched with the sour scent of rotting wood. “Are your parents here?” I pressed my wrinkled robes against the back of my chair as I caught a glimpse of my aging face in the polished reflection of the wooden coving. “Just so I know someone is here to take you home.”
</p>
<p>
	“I’m sorry father, but can’t we just pretend? You can pretend to be God.”
</p>
<p>
	The lawnmower’s chain purred a second time.
</p>
<p>
	“Pretend? Aren’t you<strong>‒</strong>don’t you think you’re too old? Ten, right?”
</p>
<p>
	“And I’ll pretend to be me.”
</p>
<p>
	“Are your parents somewhere inside the church?”<br/>	The chain cut through the atmosphere again, annunciating every link in the chain this time.
</p>
<p>
	“And I’ll tell you the sins.”
</p>
<p>
	“Son, you are free to ask me any questions… I’m sorry but you have to answer some of mine. Are your parents nearby?” The silence was shameful this time, like nobody knew we were alone. “I am so sorry, but I can’t pretend to be God for you. But you can nurture your own relationship with Him though. Every act of prayer builds that relationship<strong>‒</strong>” The booth’s door swung open then closed with a gentle click. The lawnmower burst to life.
</p>

	Deep down inside, we aren’t mostly good or evil; we’re mostly bright red. This was abundantly obvious through the translucent mess of wrinkled skin curling away from Harriot’s face as a torrent of air ripped through the cabin. First class seats tumbled through the aisle as the plane dipped through the clouds; hellbound. Harriot’s body hugged the back of her chair with two limp arms, joints ejecting from their sockets as the prickly nylon seatbelt struggled to hold on to what was left of the elderly woman. Lukewarm Sprite bubbled up in my esophagus.
</p>
<p>
	The screams of the passengers morphed into a single piercing hum vibrating at the same frequency of the metal folding in around us. As I reached out a feeble arm in her direction, I felt a nauseating sort of relief when her seat was finally torn from the floor, sent bounding off the cabin walls as she joined the cascade of debris headed for Coach. 
</p>
<p>
	The overhead bins cued into the chaos, opening simultaneously to shower the cabin with hotel toiletries. One round piece of pink baggage sprouting white fur around the zipper bludgeoned a man in 5A before snagging an armrest and showering the cabin with a collection of Barbie dolls. I watched them plummet down the aisle, whipping by the apathetic faces of the parish’s youngest children, held captive by a blend of raw fear and the stiff nylon of their Sunday clothes. A bag coated in hard black plastic spiralled down the aisle, effortlessly snapping through the arms of a couple interlocking hands between rows. The teen in the seat to my right had drifted off to the delicate harmonies of The Expendables III and wouldn’t wake to feel himself die.
</p>
<p>
A rose shaped perfume tumbled from the overhead bins and collided with my emergency mask, collapsing the bridge of my nose and shattering upon impact. The world lit up with the rich scent of vanilla and a funeral reception as my head was swallowed by the headrest. The facemask sunk further into my face, threatening intubation.
</p>
<p>
 The aluminium wall across the aisle wobbled inward, pursed its metallic lips, and vomited. The sky opened up and the clouds wafted in. Headrests tore from seats like velcro along a Sketcher flashing emergency-light green. A suitcase caught the edge of 6A and peeled open, releasing a parade of silk scarfs that gently drifted up the aisle. As they wrapped themselves around armrests, chairlegs, and drink carts, my heart sank with the hope that they might actually slow our descent. Nevertheless, I knew we would get where we were going.
</p>
<p>
I puked. This time the cocktail of pretzels and Sprite made it as far as my uvula before the mixture was pushed back down my throat, coating the insides of my chest and pressing a sharp thumb against my sternum. 
</p>
<p>
<em>I don’t want to die with this taste in my mouth.</em>
</p>
<p>
	As the vacuum peeled at my dry skin, I rolled my eyes towards the gaping hole in the side of the aircraft and decided it was okay to feel pitiful. I closed my eyes and let my daydreams wander into the clouds as my vision spiralled into a pinhole. Through the smudged glass of the window seat porthole, the clouds had passed like the frivolous scenery of a carnival shooting gallery. Now they were wet, loud and stinging my sinuses as they whipped through my skull. A flash of neon red flickered as a nylon belt writhed across the cabin floor.
</p>
<p>
	<em>When did I start crying?</em>
</p>
<p>
	When I looked back out the hole, my eyes bulged through the wiry cage of inflamed blood vessels that gripped them. I reached out a limp wrist to swat away an eye floater, but instead it grew larger, then more complex, then it was a textured palette of dark blue hurtling towards me at 740 kilometres per hour: an ocean dotted with islands. I decided to take a deep breath but had only begun to flare my nostrils when the earth caught us.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
The summer heat sweated out the mahogany cologne of the confessional booth, drenching me in the musk of one hundred years of shame. The warm wood was comforting. I had fond memories of the whispered creaks of the pews and the wood beveling gently as I sat. Everything was always softer in direct sunlight.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey Father‒”
</p>
<p>
	“Jeez‒...yep, uh huh,” I jolted, shivering out a surprised smile in response to the rasp of a familiar voice. I snuck a look through the slats of the screen. The mucus trailing from the raw corners of his nostrils shivered as he breathed, glistening amber in the sunlight. His eyes were too big for his face and his pupils were too big for his eyes. His hair was pasted in a shallow arc across the tip of his forehead, like he was anticipating baldness. 
</p>
<p>
	“Lord…will not hold him…guiltless…guiltless that taketh his name in vain, ” He squeaked between breathless sobs. 
</p>
<p>
	“Yep, I know, I know” I tried working my annoyed chuckles over his cries, like I might fool him into laughing. “So you are ten? I was ten at one point but um…what’s ten like?” I smiled. He continued to cry.
</p>
<p>
	“Father, I’m sorry but I need to talk to God.”
</p>
<p>
	My lips peeled apart the saliva bonding them together and mouthed the first vowel of a dozen sentences. I went with my thirteenth choice.
</p>
<p>
	“He is here.”
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t…I don’t know…”
</p>
<p>
“He is, I promise. I can feel his presence right now. Listen, what’s your name?”
</p>
<p>
“Jack.”
</p>
<p>
“Jack. And you said you’re ten, Jack?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well Jack, my name is Lester and I’m 49. I’m an adult. Would I lie to you Jack?” The words had felt genuine in my head.
</p>
<p>
“I guess not…”
</p>
<p>
“Jack, He is here. I promise I can feel him right now.”
</p>
<p>
	“Father, where do you feel him?”
</p>
<p>
	“It’s not quite like that.” I made a quick glance over my right shoulder.
</p>
<p>
	“And He’s listening?”
</p>
<p>
	“Almost always”
</p>
<p>
	“Almost?” He sniffled.
</p>
<p>
	“Well He’s no Santa,” I waved my hands, pawing at an explanation. “I think He’s more practical.”
</p>
<p>
	“He’s not real you know,” The boy offered, choking out a knowing smile and wiping away a tear.
</p>
<p>
“No Jack, I really do feel his presence with you. You know, you can nurture your own relationship with Him. Every act of prayer builds that relationship and someday‒”
</p>
<p>

    “Father, I think you said that already. Besides, I meant Santa.” He peaked back through
</p>
<p>
the gate at me this time. “Don’t you know Santa is a fake? Didn’t someone tell you that, Father?”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh yeah, of course.” A shiver crept out from behind my ears and rattled down my shoulders.
</p>
<p>

    “How did you find out?” It was the first time I had seen him smile, if only a little.
</p>
<p>

    “How about this, I’ll tell you my story if you tell me your story first.” I smiled back.
</p>
<p>
“It’s…um.. It was nothing… I learned…” Sadness leaked from every crevice of his memory as snot once again boiled up in his nose. His muscles twitched under the heavy wool of his suit jacket. “Father, I have faith in God. But I just wanted to know…” The words jumped from his quivering bottom lip, “I wanted to talk with Him. I had a message…I wrote it in a letter. Santa is magic and God is magic so I thought maybe one could tell the other or… I dunno. I left it with the cookies. Anyways, my…parents didn’t want my imagination to run too wild, I guess. The whole thing was silly.” I watched as his fingers absentmindedly traced along a blotched patch of skin that disappeared behind the scratchy linen of a comically oversized tie. 
</p>
<p>
	It was a bruise tucked just behind his stiff collar.
</p>
<p>
	“How about you?”
</p>
<p>
	“My story was something like that too. I was also…pretty curious.” My voice felt sluggish and fading as my eyes remained locked on the bruise.
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, cool.”
</p>
<p>
The sunlight cut through the humidity and warmed the soles of my church shoes. Despite his magnificently pale skin, the bruise was greedy with the light. The longer I gazed the less I saw of him.  “Father, you should know that it’s not like I was doubting my faith. It’s dumb‒I didn’t‒it was stupid.”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack, It’s fine. I was the same way.” I wandered my eyes around the collapsed corners of the booth as my arm idley made a soothing pass along the curve of my neck. “I’m sorry, but do you have a sin to confess?” I went to check my watch only to realize I wasn’t wearing it. The boy blinked hard, sucked down his snot and looked back down at his church Consuls.
</p>
<p>
	“Father, can I swear here?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
	“Swear on what?”
</p>
<p>
	“I mean, like, the ‘f’ word.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, it’s not a mortal sin…”
</p>
<p>
	“But are you going to tell?”
</p>
<p>
	“You won’t tell me who your parents are so‒”
</p>
<p>
	“Fuck.” The word seemed jumble and uncomfortable in his mouth, like his lips couldn’t hold it together. It was mostly a misty spit; spit that hung over our heads for a tense moment. He stared straight ahead like he hadn’t realized he could string such violent syllables together. It was like he had spit out something sharp and now he was back to crying. “Father, please don’t tell.”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack,” I nodded at him. We had both decided to ignore the thin veil of privacy offered by the screen. “Has anyone told you about the Seal of Confession?”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
	“Do you know what that means for you, or anyone lucky enough to chat with me.” He didn’t smile. “You know, most people around here would agree that I’m pretty funny.”
</p>
<p>
	“You can’t share peoples confessions.” 
</p>
<p>
	“Exactly, I can’t tell anybody anything you tell me. If I do, I’m excommunicated which is like being kicked out of your family. Do you understand this?” 
</p>
<p>
	“So if I said poop”
</p>
<p>
	“Yep.” I worried my words didn’t weigh as heavily in his mind as they had in my mouth.
</p>
<p>
	“Or shit”
</p>
<p>
	“That as well,” I shifted uncomfortably as a wry smile snuck past his lips, blinking his eyes dry. “It’s just a rule. It’s older than me and it’s older than you so that’s the way it is. I can’t tell anyone whether you swore or whether you…I dunno, killed a dog or something.”
</p>
<p>
	“Father, someone killed a dog?”
</p>
<p>
	“I can’t say. But if you had I couldn’t tell your parents and I couldn’t tell the police.”
</p>
<p>
“And you don’t give a shit if I swear?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not like you have to do it all the time.” He giggled to himself, smudging the skin where his tears were not quite dry. He sat up straight and pulled his collar tight over his neck.
</p>
<p>
“Cool.”
</p>
<p>
“Awesome. Now, Is there anything else on your conscience, Jack?”
</p>
<p>

The shoreline was tough under my feet. My toes stung like they might fall asleep. The sun had barely found its way over the clouds but I already felt my knee caps slipping around in their sockets. The ocean pounded against the shore as the wind threw lazy punches in my face. The salt sliced through the crispy layers of skin that wrapped around my fleshy lips. The perch had awoken my appetite, leaving pieces of last meal strung between my teeth. I scanned the shoreline, desperate for God to run a second miracle aground. 
</p>
<p>
Instead, I found Debora Lee.
</p>
<p>
Her cheeks bloated past her nose like she had held her breath the entire ride from the wreckage. Even her husband, Garth, who casually commented on every subtle change in her form, would have been left speechless. 
</p>
<p>
<em>I bet Garth is dead. Good for Debora.</em>
</p>
<p>
I stood and stared, like I was waiting for her to talk. She loved to talk. I remembered her pudgy fingers awkwardly pushing crumbling shortbread through a small tear in the bottom left corner of the confessional screen.
</p>
<p>
<em>I would fucking love a shortbread.</em>
</p>
<p>
I didn’t know how long I had stared, nor how the sun could tell me, but it had traveled some ways across the sky. I walked inland. My feet found harder ground as the patches of sand sprouted sharp bits of spongy sedimentary rock. I curled my toes as I made my way up a stretch that sloped into dead grass before shooting outwards over the sea: a mountainous sheer slab of rock that hung precariously over the ocean. The slab was just as wide as my bowed legs could waddle. So I started waddling. I locked my focus on the grimest hue of gray that lurked beyond the ocean, and imagined I was walking through a storm cloud. I would burst through the thick sheets of sea mist at any moment and bathe in sunlight. I kept walking. My breath shook with the growing roar of the waves shredding pieces of frail rock from the shore below. I took careful steps. I tasted blood. I winced as a jet of ocean spray cleaved the tip of my nose. I stopped. I looked downwards to face a drop that denied my depth perception. It was a brilliant matte painting depicting the torrent of the ocean current swirling amongst the rocks below. I looked back towards my camp, hoping to find an oasis in my miniature storm. It still just looked like a hole in the ground. I looked up to the sun. I couldn’t find it. Everything was either grey or soaking wet.
</p>
<p>
I began to scream.
</p>
<p>
*
</p>
<p>
	“Are you going to ask her?” I leaned in towards the screen, giddy with anticipation. 
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know. Father, I’m not gonna tell you stuff if you’re just going to ask for more stuff.”
</p>
<p>
	“What? You should ask her!” I beamed.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t even know if I’m gonna go! We just hang out in the gym. You know It's not like the movies. It’s barely a real dance.”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack. Listen, you might remember the rejection fondly, but the second guessing is something you’ll never forget. So don’t be nervous.” I massaged my palms into the glossy grooves of the bench. The wood stuck to my fingertips with a particular kind of frost that numbed my fingers and sent a warmth dancing up my arms.
</p>
<p>
	“I told you I’m not nervous. But thank you, Father.”
</p>
<p>
	“Is there anything else you need to say” 
</p>
<p>
I had found myself nurturing conversations out of the boy, asking hopelessly boring questions that encouraged long and senseless responses. His stories had grown richer throughout the summer and fall. They were stories handcrafted by a life unwinding before itself. Fragmented and split into tangents about the paint chipped from a bike or the advantages of the bagel setting on his toaster; they were delightfully scattered. But most crucially to my interest, they unveiled a wealth of untapped nostalgia. I assumed my feelings to be love. Not the brand that might have intrigued the acrylic topped nails of local reporter, January Ainsley, but a brand of fatherly love. It wasn’t criminal to find myself enthralled by the boy’s simple life.
</p>
<p>
	“Well, did you take anyone?” Jack cut in.
</p>
<p>
	“I beg your pardon.”
</p>
<p>
	“To the dance…You said you grew up on Livermore Street, you must have gone to Eldritch, right?”

	“Jack, I remember every dance fondly, regardless of the awkward stuff. I don’t really want to talk about the details…”
</p>
<p>
	“Father, You know I don’t tell people about our conversations.”
</p>
<p>
	“I know but‒”
</p>
<p>
“I mean… you’re probably my best friend right now, Father..”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack… You barely know me.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well, I know but, you…you listen and my mom doesn't listen. She would but she’s just been so…out of it. And you know me. You know me so well. I feel like, with The Seal and everything I can tell you things. I know you can’t tell anyone.” I smiled to myself. I didn’t want to tell anyone. I wanted to live in the mundane innocence of his prepubescent world.
</p>
<p>
	“I threw my metal <em>Leave It To Beaver </em>lunch box at a lunch monitor once,” I blurted. Jack’s head shot up and his eyes glowed with intrigue.
</p>
<p>
	“Why?”
</p>
<p>
	“Tell me about your day and I will share the details.” His smile spread into a toothy grin that could have been mistaken for mischief if his eyes didn’t beam with innocence. He started to talk, and I got lost in the world that he spun out before me.

My belly screamed my mind awake with the fury of a month’s hunger. I emerged slowly from my sandy grave, collapsing onto my elbows and knees the moment I began to stand. Successfully resurrected, I launched into my daily routine, carefully scooping the sand back into the hole, roughing off the edges with the dedicated branch and shuffling a blanket of ferns over the grave. My bed was made. I delicately placed the “squaring stick” parallel with my bed and grabbed what would become my “impaling stick” once it impaled an unlucky fish. Determined to shake off the warm hug of delirium, my routine had become stricter in the past three days: clean off the pit; unhinged stabbing at the ocean until the sun was directly overhead; five sips of rain water from the dwindling puddle located inland.
</p>
<p>
The island’s sunlight was filtered by a swarm of clouds and ocean spray, stretching the days into a gray puddle, divided only by the wind’s sudden shifts in direction and temperament. I only made eleven sloppy steps along the shore before I noticed a twinkling shock to the day’s monotony.
</p>
<p>
It was a light.
</p>
<p>
A soft doughy light. Originating somewhere off between the milky grey that divided the horizon and the sky, was a light the size of the church bus, sweeping back and forth along the millions of tiny rocks too jagged and small to be pebbles but too large to pass for a sand. What little of the island that could cast a shadow did in the wake of this almost sunbeam. But it wasn’t a sunbeam, it was something else. I shook the salty crust from my bloodstained eyes, following the nearly perfect sway of the light.
</p>
<p>
Left then right.
</p>
<p>
Left then right.
</p>
<p>
Left then right.
</p>
<p>
Left.
</p>
<p>
Then right.
</p>
<p>
But it wasn’t perfect. It shook with a subtle twitch, almost scared to cast its view across the island. I admired a shockingly decrepit hand as my body raised it past my head and dangled it in the air. I gave the light a neighborly wave, hopelessly friendly. I opened my mouth to speak, but my words tasted like the slimy residue coating my throat as my body devoured itself from the inside. I tried again, this time coughing up what little air I had managed to suck in that morning.
</p>
<p>
“<em>hey…</em>” I gasped. “<em>Hey…you.</em>” I felt the muscles in my throat twist and shuffle into place as they learned to form my voice again. “Hey.” I stood up a little straighter, hoisting my diaphragm above my hips and stretching my neck into the sky. “Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.” My throat felt warm in the light. “Hey! Hey! Hello! Hey! You! Hello!” I was screaming. I bellowed my greetings. “Please! Please! Lord please! Please! DO YOU SEE ME! DO YOU SEE ME!” I collapsed to my knees, tears stinging the fissures running like veins down my face. “I know you see me. I’m the only one here. I know you see me.” My voice trailed off giving into the tremendous weight of gravity.
</p>
<p>
The light didn’t vanish, It didn’t stop in place, it didn’t flail wildly, it continued its motion.
</p>
<p>
“You know I ate the perch,” I mumbled.
</p>
<p>
Left then right.
</p>
<p>
Left then right.
</p>
<p>
Left then right.
</p>
<p>
It was different.

“Father, are you going to molest me?”
</p>
<p>
“Wha‒Oh my… shhh‒oh my, Jack!” I hid in my shallow anger. “Why even‒Who said‒ Why would you say that?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry, I’m so sorry. It’s just‒”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t say that, it makes it worse” I glanced around through the worn slats in the wood that covered the confessional booth.
</p>
<p>
“It’s just that I asked Melissa to dance and she said no and this other guy, Tom Berwick‒” Tears welled in his eyes as the words spilled from his mouth like oily molasses. “And I guess I thought I liked Tom because Tom gave me one of his DanActives at lunch once and then Tom asked why I asked Mellissa and I told him about one of our conversations and he asked me why I took your advice so I told him about the rest of our conversations.” Tears were quietly trickling down his flush red cheeks and a bubble of snot yo-yoed from his left nostril. “And he said that his dad told him about this newspaper story about people like you doing things to people like me‒”
</p>
<p>

    “Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay. Jack. Look at me.”
</p>
<p>
	“Mm hm.” His eyes ballooned with sadness as he peeked through the screen.
</p>
<p>
	“I wouldn’t ever do anything to hurt you. I wouldn’t ever let anyone hurt you.” The words tasted sour. “I wouldn't ever let anyone hurt‒you.” It felt like the “t” in “wouldn’t” was getting caught between my teeth. “Wouldn’t. Wouldn’t. Wouldn’t. Wouldn’t. I would not ever. Not ever. I‒”
</p>
<p>
	“Father? Are you okay?”
</p>
<p>
	“I would not ever let anyone hurt you. Okay? Do you understand?” Jack nodded gently almost to agree only partially.
</p>
<p>
	“Can you say it? Can you say I understand?”
</p>
<p>
	“I understand.”
</p>
<p>
	“Good. Good. Awesome.”
</p>
<p>
	“I mean‒” Jack inhaled in his snot, running his hands over the wrinkles that decorated his suit jacket. “It’s just that Darren said the same thing about you to mom.”
</p>
<p>
	“Darren? Who’s Darren,” I whistled my words softly, regretting the moment they left my lips.
</p>
<p>
	“He’s just just this guy dating my mom.”
</p>
<p>
	“Oh, okay.”
</p>
<p>
 	“You know Father, I think you’re probably taller than him. ”
</p>
<p>
	“Why would you say that?”
</p>
<p>
	“So you might know about how tall he is: a little shorter than you.” The tears began to form again as he loosened his cheap tie into a dangling noose. He winced, as he rubbed his hand along his neck in a familiar motion. It was soothing to watch, but terrifying to witness. “Father, I know you said I can’t but I really think I wanna talk to God.”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack, I don’t know what to say. Do you want a hug?”
</p>
<p>
	“Are we allowed to see each other outside the booth?”
</p>
<p>
“If you’re comfortable with it.” He paused, lost in himself for a moment then looked up with a smile.
</p>
<p>
	“Yes, please.”
</p>
<p>
	“Great.”
</p>
<p>
	“And Father.”
</p>
<p>
	“Yes?”
</p>
<p>
	“I know you won’t molest me.”
</p>
<p>
	“Well okay, that’s… um… that’s very kind of you Jack.”

My routine had been altered slightly since my first encounter with the Light. I had maintained my living quarters but completely abandoned my “impaling stick”, instead choosing to spend my mornings crossed legged on the beach gazing towards the Light as I waited patiently for another perch. The Light’s appearances were frequent and regular, always gently sweeping from left to right, always stopping once the sun was directly above my head. The Light felt timid and restrained: He couldn’t scream like direct sunlight. He seemed to caress my shaggy beard sloppily, massaging my face back and forth, His nails were manicured unlike the sun’s gawky acrylics. It was a rich kind of warmth, one that lit every part of my face evenly, even the shadows guarded by my double chin. 
</p>
<p>
The warmth was reminiscent of my nights spent slowly inching back from the sweltering black steel of Grandmother’s back boiler stove as the heat grew overwhelming. I always held my face up against the flames, listening to the snaps and pops that sprung from the fire. I imagined a conversation from the other room in the noise; muffled voices fighting, meandering, then making up. The nights were long and Grandmother’s house was small. Every surface was expertly carpeted, connecting the kitchen and the only other room with an ocean of Elmo red. The wood paneling dividing the spaces was a privacy curtain that enraged Grandmother to scream when it accidentally buckled under my absentminded slouching. The paneling constantly sweated a glossy resin, except during the Winter when it would crumble like ancient plastic. I learned that the single bedroom locked from the outside when Grandmother needed to work her nightly shift at the only Hardee’s in town that still proudly displayed a Sandy’s sign. I waited and stewed in the conversations illuminated through the flames, memories of happy Christmases, Thanksgivings and Easters that had never belonged to me. Once Grandmother returned at 11:00 PM, she spoke louder than the fire, detailing the many ways my mother was drunkenly poisoning our family name. Mother would sometimes return four hours later and explain through slurred speech and heavy lips why our family tree is nothing more than a stick stuck crooked in the earth. I would then lay down next to both generations, relax my eyelids, and crash into the next morning. Grandmother insisted that Sunday school was a full education and my mother could hardly account for the hours in her own day. So, I spent my hours, days, and years bouncing between the church and the boiler, avoiding the rest of the world like the loose thread that would unravel my only good shirt.
</p>
<p>
I followed the Light even as I strained to keep my eyeballs spinning in their sockets and felt a gnawing hunger working its way up my throat. Every so often the Light would pause for a moment and I would make markings on the spots it lingered. I molded sand into mounds of varying sizes reflecting how long He had paused. I enjoyed organizing the Light’s thoughts, watching His plan unfurl before my eyes, engraved permanently into the earth.
</p>

The hinges along the doors of the confession booths were infected with rust and elicited a growl with the coming and going of each guest. Each guest tamed the noise with a unique technique. Some yanked the door shut like choking out a dying animal's final gasp for life. Others were slow, methodical, and preposterously loud. I learned that Jack always gave the door three gentle tugs, skipping past the most deafening cries and allowing the heavy pine to swing itself shut. This time the hinges screamed with the twist of a hunting knife. I hardly recognized him.
</p>
<p>
“Father?” he sobbed, resting a tired hand on the screen. His hands were scalded and raw. His neck was laced with dark purple stripes, like his veins were swollen. I think I spotted a thumbprint on his adams apple.
</p>
<p>
“Mm-hm,” I nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Father?”
</p>
<p>

    “Yep. Yes?”
</p>
<p>

    “I’m sorry but I really need to talk with God.”
</p>
<p>

    “Jack. Why don’t we just talk about your day at school.”
</p>
<p>

    “Father.” He sobbed the word like it was wrapped around his sinuses. “I need you to-”
</p>
<p>

    “Jack, I asked you if you understood the Seal? Remember?
</p>
<p>

    “Please.”
</p>
<p>

    “You know I can’t tell anyone anything.”
</p>
<p>

    “Father, please. Please, please, please, please, please.”
</p>
<p>
“Jack,” I composed a stern and cold tone, “Jack, be strong and courageous; do not be frightened or dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go‒”
</p>
<p>
	“Shut up please.”
</p>
<p>
	“We walk by faith, not by sight.”
</p>
<p>
“Shut up please, Father.” His eyes were shut and his nose was in a bunch. “Ok. Ok. I’ll talk to God later. I’ll just tell you.”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack. I don’t know if‒”
</p>
<p>
	“They aren’t my sins.”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack, please-”
</p>
<p>
	“Darren grabbed my throat and‒”
</p>
<p>
	“Dammit Jack!! I can’t tell anybody anything. We agreed I was just here to listen. You know this. You know about The Seal. You know this. Please. ” His sobs turned to heavy breaths and his heavy breaths turned to silence. I felt a tear sneak down my cheek and nestle in my beard. I looked back towards Jack, hoping to find the top of a disheveled head, but his eyes stared straight ahead. He looked at me, then through me. “This isn’t supposed to happen. Not to you. Tell someone else. Just tell someone else.”
</p>
<p>
	“My mom won’t‒Nobody wants to listen.”
</p>
<p>
	He left without another word.

The creamy blue and grey pastels of the waiting room were disarming. The exterior of the police station was fortified by layers of brick that could have been placed by hand, but the interior was fluffy. The same thin pale lime cushion that ballooned from the seats of every chair also sprung from the table. The staplers, desks, televisions and plants, were all crafted from right angles, like a dollhouse pungent with gun oil. The bliss was unnerving. I folded my collar over in my hands, as I waited to provide a detailed account of Jack’s situation to the officer I had met over the phone.
</p>
<p>
	“Father? My goodness is that you? How are you? I haven’t seen you outside the church in well - well I don’t know if I ever have. How are things? How are you?” Debora Lee bombarded me with question after question, emboldened by my silence. She monologued about the fire hydrants’ hideous new shade of red, Harriet’s burnt branzino at the potlatch, and the crazy downpour we’ve gotten over the last few days. I sat still and attentive, hoping she might tire herself before training her focus back to me.
</p>
<p>
	“And why are you here?”
</p>
<p>
	<em>Shit.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>	</em>“Hmm?”
</p>
<p>
	“What has brought you to the station this fine Monday morning.”
</p>
<p>
	<em>Shit. Shit.</em>
</p>
<p>
<em>	</em>“Father, it’s not about the thing I told you about Dale’s dog. God rest his soul,” She leaned in and lowered her voice, “Because I thought you weren’t allowed to talk about stuff like that.”
</p>
<p>
	“Nope, it’s not that. And you’re right I’m not.”
</p>
<p>
	“But it is someone from the church, though? Did something happen?” Debora Lee’s pupils dilated to make space for the rumor ruminating between the thickest parts of her skull, preparing to spew like vomit from her mouth.
</p>
<p>
“No, no. It’s really nothing. I was just leaving.” I assured her as I stood.
</p>
<p>
“Father, I didn’t mean to pry. Honestly, I’m just trying to butter you up a lil’ because Rose’s book club is tonight, so I will definitely be seeing you in the booth tomorrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I look forward to that, Debora Lee.”
</p>
<p>
I left the police station, shoulders slumped and my collar tucked so tight I coughed for breath. 
</p>
<p>
*
</p>
<p>
Babara Lee looked gilded by obsidian in the passing glimpses of the Light. Her thighs had curled into tight shells of rotting flesh stark in their blackness. Her skin hoarded the Light like it was embarrassed to be seen. But I saw it. I saw the bubbling veins of red that clung to the flayed pieces of her Tommy Bahama. I saw the salt that crested every double chin and preserved the blue faced shock that puckered her lips. I saw the tide tug lightly at the tattered remains of her bright red bob cut, plucking individual hairs and stealing entire globs of scalp as a result. I didn’t see Debora Lee.
</p>
<p>
	But I still saw the Light. More than saw, I watched, observed, appreciated, worshiped. I gave my despair, my deliria, my exhaust, my hunger to the Light. My attention was viscous, slipping from one moment to another and straining just long enough in the middle to catch glimpses of the Light. Morning melted into afternoons and evenings into more mornings as sharp rocks squeezed into the gashes in my knees. 
</p>
<p>
Then one day the Light moved, swinging right and resting on the peak of the rock that screamed from the earth and hung out over the sea. I decided to go to it, leaving the scattered mounds of sand behind. From the beach, the piles looked disorganized and random but the peak of the rock offered a new perspective. Who was I to turn down a perspective offered by the Light, to see the entirety of His plan.
</p>
<p>
	 My legs buckled under the cobwebs that had taken up the hollow between my ribs and spine. I felt the wind slice away at the dense layers of dead skin that curled from my toes to my heel. I tried to imagine myself in the Light as the rocks loomed closer, struggling to find humanity in the dangling mess of limbs held together by loose skin.
</p>
<p>
	My excess weight had fallen away from my stomach, my chins recessed into my neck, my arms shriveled. My ankles teetered on the tops of my feet like cursive through a ballpoint pen. My heart beat hard to illuminate the pale veil of skin draped over my circulatory system. My mouth dangled agap because the overwhelming urge to smile hurt my teeth.
</p>
<p>
	As I reached the shallow dip where the beach turned to grass, I noticed a difference in the Light’s behaviour: it was moving vertically in jerking motions, up to the peak of the rock, then back down to the treacherous waters below. With each sudden dip of the Light I felt the earth drop underneath the dry grass that tickled my feet. I puckered my eyebrows, gave the terrain a stern nod, and marched onward.
</p>
<p>
	The sandpaper beach had grated off the dead skin, so there was nothing left between the pink flesh along the soles of my feet and stone sedimentary slivers. The rock stretched thin out over the sea, like the earth had bubbled up and spewed black bile into the sky. The stone felt aflame under my feet as I took my first steps into the ocean mist made brilliant by the shine of the Light. Each step echoed with pain.
</p>
<p>
	Right foot. The wind took my eyelash, plucked one by one.
</p>
<p>
	Left foot. The sea water soaked my face as the droplets grew larger, peeling away the salty slips of dead skin weaved into my chin and face.
</p>
<p>
	Right foot. The wind flicked away the smattering of hairs clinging to dead skin.
</p>
<p>
	Left foot. Dragging my foot, I felt a stray piece of rock slide under the skin, leaving a palm-sized flap leaking blood. I didn’t feel a thing.
</p>
<p>
	Right foot. The mist grew angrier, blowing open the webbing between my fingers and toes, as the Light grew brighter over the horizon.
</p>
<p>
	Left foot. The wind flailed and contorted, mangling my shirt and dress pants before tearing them away all together.
</p>
<p>
Right foot. Every fibre of my hair curled around my frail skeleton, pressed matte by the thick wall of mist.
</p>
<p>
	Left foot. Awestruck, I stared into the face of the Light as it shot up to the peak of the rock.
</p>
<p>
	Suddenly the mist faded into my peripheral, the wind sunk beneath the rock, and I was utterly alone with the Light. Heavy breaths rattled the tiny bones in my skull. Every digit was numb. I followed the motion of the Light with my every being, bobbing up to meet it, then back down, below my feet and into the abyss. It shot carelessly up the cliff, lingered, then descended like Holy Water, heavy and thick with divinity; beckoning. I felt a smile begin to twitch and imagined the Light was smiling back. I faced out towards the beach below, endowed with a new perspective, but struggled to see through the salty droplets that hung heavy on my eyelids.
</p>
<p>
	I brought two hands to my face to wipe the salt water, but felt the shine on my face dim when I found someone else’s skin. The mist had stripped away everything extra, leaving a perfectly round doughy face and a hairline that was preparing to bald. I worked my way down until I was cradling my neck, my hands slipping as I massaged the veins bulging through the shallow surface. It felt delicate and vulnerable in my hands; utterly helpless. Like a child.
</p>
<p>
Finally seeing the Light’s plan clearly, the hills of sand looked like uneven polka dots, disgusting skin tags on the face of the shoreline. The more my fingertips grazed, the quicker my smile dissipated and tears brewed in the deep sockets of my brown eyes. The same eyes followed the path of the Light once again, past my feet and onto the jagged mess of rocks below. Whatever His plan, it didn’t involve me.
</p>
<p>
	“I know.” I felt the graveled rumble of a dying voice against my fingertips. Mucus streamed in tiny veins across my wet cheeks, but I was too numb to notice. The Light seemed so small in the distance, barely a sparkle.
</p>
<p>
	“This wasn’t supposed to happen. Not to you.”
</p>
<p>
	Left foot. I felt my stomach plunge.
</p>
<p>
* * *
</p>
<p>
I flicked my wrists up and slowly brought them back down as pointed bits of grass dug into my heels and butt. My eyes were fixed past the beach onto the gray of the horizon.
</p>
<p>
	Up, then down.
</p>
<p>
	“Hey kid.” I saw Darren’s shadow painted across my back before he spoke a word.
</p>
<p>
	Up, then down.
</p>
<p>
	“Jack.”
</p>
<p>
	Up, then down.
</p>
<p>
	“Dammit Jack. Put down the mirror.” 
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>

    “Jack.”
</p>
<p>

    “No.”
</p>
<p>

    “It’s been weeks, I don’t think you’re going to signal anybody.” I watched the sunlight
</p>
<p>
ricochet off the mirror and dance somewhere beyond the gray of the horizon.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t just sit there all day, while everybody else does shit. You tried but what’s the plan now?” I turned to find his eyes. They were glossy but dark, hidden by a prominent forehead and two heavy brows that loomed over the rest of his face.
</p>
<p>
	“I don’t know. Are we going to die here?” His eyebrows dropped and the wrinkles along his forehead softened. 
</p>
<p>
	“Listen Jack, you have to understand‒”
</p>
<p>
	“I just really need to talk to God before we die.”
</p>
<p>
	“Fucking dammit Jack!” Five meaty fingers wrapped nearly twice around my wrist and I immediately jolted backwards. He yanked hard towards his chest. The pressure built as my wrist folded away from my body and my fingertips turned blue.
</p>
<p>
	“Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop” My plees deflated into squeaky whispers until he finally released.
</p>
<p>
	“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
	“Why did you do that?” Tears welled in my eyes.
</p>
<p>
	“Why did you jump backwards? It’s weird when you jump backwards. Don’t do that.”
</p>
<p>
	“But I didn’t‒”
</p>
<p>
	“Jack, listen. Remember when I read your note to Santa? Remember‒” He swiveled his head to ensure nobody had returned from foraging as his scorn changed into a condescending whisper. “Remember when we said we wouldn’t write stuff like that down? People are going to think that I‒You know mom isn’t well and she doesn’t need that shit, okay?” I nodded, avoiding eye contact as I rubbed two fingers along the purple ring beginning to form around my wrist. Darren dropped the mirror into the sand by his side and stood up straight. “I’m heading back to the others. I expect to see you there.” The moment he was lost in the trees, I scrambled to pick up the mirror and continued signalling with the sunlight.
</p>

Sagitarii explodes as a massive supernova, scattering cosmic gasses and dust across the Milky Way that are eventually molded by gravitational forces into a blue and green planet containing the same copper woven not far beneath the surface.

            “It’s not that simple.”
            “What does it do?”
        The box was a small manilla tv, all angles with a great glass belly. No bigger than Will’s HAM radio, which was sputtering white noise in some closet, tucked away from the orange fluorescent hum of the lab. It sat before him on a flattened drafting bench, pressed deep into the corner, just far enough from the light to lose where the device ended and the wall began. A four inch slit through the top sprouted a trail of ticker tape that cascaded elsewhere across the desk. Will stared at the screen and the screen stared back with an open-mouthed shock imagined by the circular nob at the base of the device. He leaned back in his chair, placing a Phillip's head screwdriver on the workbench to his right. The bench was decorated with strips of bright orange masking tape, cut into the silhouettes of the various tools that Will’s tinkering required. However, nowadays, most of the slots were either empty or filled with tools tilted askew, like the whole university had shifted two millimeters right. Even as he laid back, Will still sat upright, dressed in an oversized lab coat that hung stiff off his arms like PVC piping.
            “Alright, I guess it is that simple. I just don’t feel like explaining”
            “Explain it to me face-to-face at St. Franks.”
            “I don’t feel like explaining.”
            “Are you even happy about it?”
            “Did you hear what it does?”
            “You won’t tell me, or it’s too complicated to explain, or you don’t feel like it.”
            “I know, I know. But you get the idea, right?”
            “You don’t even sound happy,” Jake covered the wrong end of his phone with a sweaty hand, “He doesn’t even sound happy.”
            “Who else is there?” There was a muffled exchange of laughter that cut through the noise of the bar.
            “Rebecca got a cat. it’s Persian, you’ll love it.”
            “Who’s Rebecca. Am I on speaker?”
            “Just get down here.”
            “Are you drunk?”
            “Yes, get drunk!”
            “I wanna try one more thing. Call me back in,” Will went to check his Timex but found only the red indents that suggested a tight squeeze. “I dunno, four minutes.”
            He ended the call and plugged the phone into a wire whose end frayed into a mess of copper wiring that sprouted from the device. He adjusted the dial, producing a spring-loaded buzz as he navigated the pointed tip past several marked grooves. One minute. Two minutes. Three minutes. Four. He stopped and felt for a heavy switch along the bottom of the device. The screen sparkled with static, dotted with specks of green and black that lit up the edges of Will’s eyes. A single fuzzy ball, easily mistaken for a scratch, grew from the center of the screen, like a tired eye struggling to open. The growing light washed the room in a misty grey warmth that tingled the edges of Will’s fingertips, pulling every hair on his body taught and wrinkling his nostrils. Rows of dull grey cabinets and skeleton shelves held their breath as the light threatened to burst through the windows. The grey eye collapsed into a single horizontal line and suddenly every noise, even the silence, was sucked from the lab. Will held his breath because it felt rude to do otherwise. The line was a pulsating neon green and began jagging up and down ever so slightly, like it was reading the heartbeat of the earth. Then the ticker tape began to move. It spilled out of the machine, nearly catching fire as Will steadied his hand underneath, careful to avoid a paper cut. The green line dipped and rose with electromagnetic fury. Then suddenly it was done and the light flickered out. Will poured over the three foot stretch of tape, passing the roll over an open palm and nodding his head. It was filled with words. Words and dashes. And to Will the words looked right. A single vertical dash indicated the voice of one speaker and two vertical dashes indicated the other. Will could tell he was the single dash. He went to check the time, but decided instead to sit and wait. He faced the window, staring out at a peculiar kind of darkness that would swallow him whole if he stepped out into the night. The machine was a miracle; the good kind.

        In Bingham Canyon, a vein of this copper is chipped away by an exhausted miner who can barely lift the sweat puddled at the steel tips of his rubber work boots. A heavy chunk is tossed into a haul truck and driven to the nearest ore processing plant in Ferron, where it is ground to pebbles then to sand. In a yellow tub stained with a dry black sludge, the powder is mixed with chemical reagents and pumped with oxygen then skimmed off the surface, free of impurities. The copper concentrate is fed into a 1,260 degree celsius smelting furnace then, once molten hot and swirling with a grainy orange colour, it is poured into an anode casting wheel. The cooled anode slab is hung in a tank filled with electrolyte solution where it undergoes fourteen days of electrolysis until it is a 375 pound slab of 99.99% pure copper.
        
        * * *
        
            The phone buzzed to life with a lo-fi rendition of a Chainsmokers song to which Will had long forgotten the name.
        “Yep.” Will traced his index finger down the ticker tape, starting at the first line of the transcript created by the device: Are you coming?
            “Are you coming?”
            I’m testing something
            “I’m testing something.”
            Finish up and get over here.
            “Finish up and get over here.”
            Pick a word.
            “Pick a word.” Somebody yelled for a Corona off in the background and the phone line went muffled for a second.
            Hmm?
            “Hmm?”
            Any word.
            “Any word.”
            J-
        Jellyfish.
            “J-”
            “Jellyfish,” Will cut in. 
            “Have we done this before?”
            “I told you. It tells me what will be said.”
            “Oh” The background hustle of the bar faded as Jake cupped his hand over the phone.
            “Exactly.”
            “So it’s not like Quantum Leap.”
            “It is not.” 
            “Alright, where will you go?”
            “Jesus, that’s not how it works.”
            “I know, but it sounds better than: what will you read?”
            “I dunno, probably something near the end.”
            “What will you read?”
            “Probably the end” Will raised his voice to be heard over the distant bar trivia.
            “Of what?”
            “My life probably.”
            “How would you know which conversation is your last?”
            “I’ll just skip a couple decades ahead and see where I end up.”
            “Are you happy to be done?”
            “I’m excited to see where I end up.”
            “But does it feel good to be done?”
            “It’s nice. It’s really nice.”
            “There’s no better feeling.”
            “Feels that way. “ Will sighed and looked down again, realigning his finger along the edge of the ticker tape.
            What if you don’t follow the script?
            “What if you don’t follow the script?”
            That’s what the test is for.
            “That’s what the test is for.”
            Oh, when does it start?
            “Oh, when does it start?”
            Shit!
            Will stared at the word and decided not to speak it. It dangled along the edge of the tape, stained with the vertical lines of an imperfect printer. He went to hang up the phone when a crash erupted from the window. “Shit!” A crow slinked down the window pane, streaking it with a line of blood that trickled from its left eye. The motion controlled lights flickered then faded entirely. Will waved his arms above his head as he approached the window, blinking the lights back to life. He traced a bony finger along the path of the blood as the animal lost its grip and slipped into the abyss. The world seemed lost in the night. His phone chimed with a text message: did it work? 
        
        * * *
        
        The slab is sent on a truck and arrives in Manitowoc, where it is cut and heated molten once more before coating a 10.9 millimeter lead-antimony alloy bullet that later compresses the gunpowder sitting at the bottom of a brass casing. But one of twenty conveyor belt instruments malfunctions by 3 millimeters and the bullet is frisked by the edge of the galvanization bath, slashing a nick into the edge of the bullet that protrudes ever so slightly. The finished bullet is sat upright amongst eleven others in a cardboard box fitted with plastic dividers and driven to Shore Galleries in Lincolnwood, just north of Chicago proper. It is stuffed among other similar boxes and shielded with a sliding glass casing. The case is then picked out and taken home by a hand of bony fingers.
        
        * * *
        
        There’s no better feeling.
        Will stared at the ticker tape, mulling the words over until they did not feel like words: stains that bled through a thin piece of paper. He silenced the phone and started spinning away at the nob. 20 years was 7,300 days was 175,200 hours was 10,512,000 minutes. The tips of his fingers were raw by the time he stopped the spinning, flipped the switch and fell back into his chair. The device awoke, sputtering under the weight of the time, but nonetheless within minutes it was vomiting a roll of ticker tape and within seconds the lab was beyond quiet once again. Will reached out for the tape, a familiar length with strangely familiar words.
        Are you coming?
        I’m testing something.
        Finish up and get over here.
        Will knocked his knees under the desk as he jolted up from the tape to check the machine. The machine read 10,512,000 in the bottom left corner of the screen, the blocky letters bent by the curve of the glass. Everything was in order. His breath knotted up in the back of his throat and his nose jammed on the smell of a cleaning solution wafting in from the hall. He continued reading.
        I’m testing something.
        You’re pretty much done. Come on.
        It doesn’t feel done.
        It never is, come on. Rebecca got a third cat, I swear to god she’s killing them.
        Say hi for me.
        Get over here.
        10 seconds.
        I’m happy I’m done you know.
        It’s the best feeling, right?
        Why do you always say that?
        I’m happy for you. Get over here.
        But it’s not as good as it could get, right? I mean, I might be happier eventually.
        Jesus, Will. Just come see your friends.
        Will’s yellowed fingernail flicked the end of the tape, looking up to find a crack blossoming from the point the bird collided with the window. He held the two strips of tape side by side. His lungs felt emptier than the night. His phone buzzed.
        “This is the last time I call.”
        “You know I know everything now. We already have everything that was ever transmitted or broadcasted and now we have everything that will ever be transmitted or broadcasted. We’re pretty much done. I’m pretty much done.”
        “Great.”
        “Great?”
        “Now come see your friends.” The call ended. Will tossed the phone aside, opened the third drawer from the bottom of the aquamarine steel cabinets and produced a .44 Magnum, heavy and cool in his frail hands. With steady fingers he removed a bullet from the case of sixteen. He chose it because of a small nick along the edge that separated it from the others. He loaded and held the weapon to his eye, staring at the bullet, but the bullet did not stare back. It had traveled a long way. His heart bounced off the inside of his ribcage as he hovered a steady finger over the trigger. He pulled. The hammer swung forward and collided with the primer, sending the nick in the copper plating dragging along the inside of the chamber until it was wedged completely, centimeters from Will’s left eye. The heat of the friction tickled his eyelash.
        He did not blink but a tear did begin to well. He tucked away the weapon, dressed himself in an oversized coat, and walked out into the abyss.

            `My AK 74 chafed my ribcage with each purposeful stride as the sounds of General Yahontov’s mid-afternoon slumber disappeared behind me. I ran my fingers along the corrugated steel walls as I stepped out onto the deck of the ship.
            I shouldn’t have been there.
                Slivers of jagged wood dug into my calluses as I dragged my apple crate along the diamond plate panels that made up the floor and set it between my feet. The scalding metal seared my cotton trousers as I sat, with the crate straddled between my legs, and began to nudge the sludge of corn and beans around my paper plate before gazing towards the sea of blue that stretched into the horizon. I set my meal on floor, raised my rifle over the open crate, and began to scan the horizon through my crosshairs, searching for excitement.
                Excitement had cracked from every gunshot and gushed from each smoke grenade as the days rounding out basic training had trudged by with agonizing suspense. Mud that curled between the divots of my boots and barbed wire that pulled at the hairs on my back should have been a relic of the past. Instead, I found myself longing for the visceral details of my training in a fit of jealousy.
            President Krushchev had needed a General to oversee Vietcong supplyment and every General needs a Spetsnaz escort. Despite the 6,615 metric tonnes of unreasonably tough steel panelling that wrapped around our patrol boat's hull, there was little it could have done to compensate for the fueling miscalculation that left our crew bobbing in the middle of the Philippine Sea. General Yahontov’s status hadn’t been enough to warrant a search party, which meant that the only thing that had kept our crew of ten alive for the past year was our scattered memories of childhood fishing.
            On the edge of my peripheral, I could see another sunburnt comrade, the ship’s engineer, slapping at the water with the mustard yellow paddles of our red safety raft, probably heading out to reel in dinner. I resisted the urge to make eye contact. A fog of isolation had set over the crew, making human interaction feel superfluous. He disappeared around the corner of the boat as a seagull came cawing out of the sun, slipping through my crosshairs and soaring over the length of our vessel. 
                I jerked my torso left, pulling my weapon into alignment with the bird, and fired. My weapon spat a mangled shell into the apple crate between my legs as the bird came toppling down from the heavens and hit the water with a wet snap. I stared down at the crate in guilt, which was now teeming with casings stacked precariously on top of each other in a monument to my marksmanship.
                I had to stay accurate, for my country.
            I set down my firearm and began to run my greasy fingers over the bullet shell looped through the necklace draped around my blazing red neck. It had been a trophy kept by my grandfather from his time in the Russo-Japanese War. It was one of several relics passed on by the list of war heroes that cascaded down our family tree. I had known it was unlikely I would join their ranks. I had thought I wouldn’t even get to fight.
            Boredom decided otherwise.
            Boredom stalked every still moment on the ship, threatening to break me at each tick of the second hand. Hours tore away at my flesh, grappling at bits of my sanity as the sun stood stubbornly overhead, refusing to budge. I wanted to scream. I wanted something. But I hadn’t decided to serve for the action. I just wanted to help my country.
            I didn’t need action. 
            I began to tear at flaking bits of my sunburnt skin to reveal a crimson layer of new flesh when I caught a glimpse of a red safety raft, roughly 100 metres from where I was sitting, peaking its way around our ship. The way the sun caught the red sheen of the raft made it difficult to make out its passenger. I crumpled the edges of my eyes as I strained to identify their face, suspecting it was my comrade returning with his catch.
                It wasn’t though. I was sure it wasn’t. Something felt off.
                I swore I could make out a familiar emblem that had been pressed onto the scratchy blend of nylon and cotton that was their shirt. The tasteless combination of crimson red, sterile white and deep navy blue were unmistakable. It was an American flag.
                The enemy.
            My vision narrowed as I snatched my rifle and pushed its butt into my shoulder until I felt a profound and satisfying ache. I stroked my finger up and down the trigger as I swayed my crosshairs into alignment with the figure. I sucked in air until my ribcage pinched the flesh above my waist. I paused for a moment, letting my finger precariously hover over the trigger as I stirred in thought.
            An American floating, on a safety raft, in the middle of the Philippine Sea. I was wrong. But I didn’t want to be wrong. I just wanted something to happen. Anything.
            “I’m sorry,” I whispered as a tear began to sting my right eye.
                I pulled once on the trigger, letting a tidal wave of noise erupt from within the barrel and expand over the surface of the water, disappearing quicker than I had hoped. The figure collapse into a viscous pool of their blood and continued to gently float towards our boat until it made contact with a thud. I reluctantly leaned over the railing to get a glimpse of his face. The corpse was shirtless and sunburnt, clutching a fishing rod in one hand and a bright yellow paddle in the other. 
            I stepped back, tossing my weapon to the ground and sucking in vomit from erupting out of my mouth. I shook my head violently as I paced back and forth across the deck, letting the thunderous clanking of my metal toed boots drown out the drone of my thoughts. 
                I fell to the floor as crew members who had noticed the body began to swarm me, pointing their weapons at my chest as they shouted unintelligible obscenities. As I shut my eyes and let reality collapse into my imagination, their shouting melted into cheers then into an enthusiastic blend of war chants. Adrenaline shot, like electricity, through my veins.
             I wasn’t bored, I wasn’t crazy. I was their hero.

            `The subtle strobe of the fluorescent bulbs nipped at my twitching eyelids as the sales clerk maneuvered us through the perfume section. The migraine-inducing stench of knock-off perfumes seeped its way into my skull. Despite the store sticking my senses with a cattle prod, one scent stuck to my nostrils as we finally exited the section. It used to be the smell of home after an exhausting eight hours: two light spritzes on Jessica’s wrist. Now I hardly recognized it without the subtle mix of someone else's cologne tainting its love, invading our space. I tucked the scent into my subconscious and pushed forward. I stroked my fingers up and down the Browning 9mm I had gingerly stuffed into my pocket, hoping to grow accustomed to its weight. Instead, it chafed a rash of guilt against my leg with each stride.
            I was going to do it. I had to follow through.
        The sales clerk’s joggers vacuum sealed the contours of his absurdly muscular calves, accentuating the reflective white strips that ran down his legs. He strode effortlessly on his Nike Free Runs, projecting confidence that stung at the deepest parts of my ego. 
            “Well, here we are buddy!” he sang, spinning on his heel and coming to a rehearsed stop. In front of us were hundreds of tiny packets stacked in neat rows, each wrapped in an ethnically ambiguous woman in a uniquely suggestive position. 
            Pantyhose. The criminal’s Halloween mask.
            “So I’m assuming this is a gift of some kind?” the clerk asked, bending his words tentatively.
            “Well… yes… um…” I stuttered, fighting for an explanation, “yes. A gift.”
        “Alrighty, then. I don’t mean to sound crass but what are the dimensions of your woman,” the clerk asked, gushing a sickening amount of cheer as he coiffed the strands of grey that spiraled down his beard.
        My brain instinctively began to comb through cherished memories of Jessica, as if I had forgotten my original intention. The sheepish look she threw my way when the waiter came and she was inevitably unprepared. Her petty sigh of disdain when someone said “two times” instead of “twice.” I fled further into my jealous rage, desperate to outrun the wave of guilt that spilled from the corners of my conscience as I began to see her as a human once again. My fingers wrapped so ferociously around the Browning that they seemed to warp the steel.
        I was going to do it. I was going to do it. I was going to do it-
            “Hey there bud?” the clerk prodded, gently swinging me back to reality. “Is everything alright? You look a little shaken.” He laid a caring palm on my shoulder.
            Was everything alright? No one had asked. I thought no one would.
        I felt my whirlwind of thoughts finally come to a complete rest as I let myself steep in his empathy, finally stepping back to see the whole picture. I didn’t have to do anything. I hadn’t committed a crime. No one had to die. 
            “Yes… Yes, everything is fine. Just a bad week, that's all,” I responded optimistically, pondering peaceful ways to confront Jessica.
            Maybe a conversation would be a nice start.
            “Hey… Um, you’ve been really helpful. I hope you know that. I was so in my head and… well… It’s not often that strangers-” I began as I yanked my hand out of my pocket to shake his, feeling an object catch the tip of my pinky and toppling unceremoniously to the floor.
            The gun. Shoot.
        I dropped my knees to the glossy linoleum, scrambling aimlessly to pick up the weapon. I stood, instinctively pointing the firearm at the clerk, expecting to look down and see my stomach still on the floor. I flung my head around, scanning the dense rows of shelves to ensure there were no spectators. We were alone. 
            “Ok. Ok. Cool. Don’t scream please,” I pleaded with the clerk, who was taking methodical steps backward, preparing his escape. “Stop!” I thrust my weapon forward and the clerk froze. 
        Holy guacamole.
        “Ok, this is cool. This is fine,” I spat shakily, mentally pacing back and forth, “pantyhose, right? I think we were talking about the dimensions of my woman. Something to that effect.” The clerk began to blubber with tears, snot coagulating in the wax of his mustache. The atmosphere felt as if it would crack under the weight of my words. “So what’s cool with pantyhose, huh? Which… uh… which pair do I need?”
        “It d-d-depends,” the clerk stuttered, barely letting words escape through his clenched teeth as tears cooled down his face.
        “Ok… well, you may have realized that I am in fact not buying them for my wife,” I chuckled nervously, “it was actually… a mask ... for… a crime.”
        “Yeah?” the clerk sobbed.
        “Yeah. Murder actually.”
        My goodness, Stop talking.
        “So what size do I need?” I prodded.
        “Um… it depends on height and weight,” the clerk wheezed, slowly tucking a shaky hand into his pocket and producing a laminated chart. I scanned the chart, which was lined with rows of boxes that had been clustered into groups labeled with letters in a seemingly haphazard way.
        “Okay. Wow. That seems a little overcomplicated, don’t you think?” I laughed, sensing no reciprocation from the clerk, “what...uh...what size do you think would fit over my head?”
        “What?”
            “My head. Which model would fit nice and snug on my head. Can’t have people seeing my face when I’m killing and whatnot,” I chuckled, choking a little. The clerk couldn’t muster the strength to move, instead focusing his energy on controlling the band of snot yo-yoing out of his nose.
        “This one maybe?” I suggested, gesturing towards a package.
        “Yep,” he choked. 
            Once I had finally scraped the pantyhose out of their package, I yanked the blend of inky black and beige over my face. Unfortunately, the garment was lined with a  menagerie of speckled black leaves, making it difficult to see. No matter how much fabric I jostled and stretched, I couldn’t settle on a configuration without any blind spots.
            “Sorry, but what are with these black leaves?” I asked the clerk, who had sensed my agitation and seemed worried I might be on the brink of pulling the trigger.
            “They’re just leaves,” he sobbed.
            “Yeah, but why decorate an undergarment. I mean, aren’t pantyhose meant to be inconspicuous? You know. I… I just wanna be on the same wavelength here.” I bantered, casually pantomiming a wave with my gun.
            “They’re from our Autumn collection,” he slobbered. “It’s meant to bring a splash of Fall to every occasion,” he finished, collapsing into a ball on the floor as he trailed off into a flurry of tears.
            “Okay, okay. It’s fine. It’s fine then,” I comforted, removing the pantyhose and crumpling them into a ball. I stared into the bloodshot eyes of my victim, guilt panging with the rhythm of my heart. His incessant sobbing had left his face a crimson wrinkled mess lined with peaks of crusty mucus. He didn’t even look human.
        I dropped my firearm and slunk to the floor, finding a place next to the clerk as tears welled in my eyes.
            I can do good.
            “Hey, you’ve seen my face but that doesn’t matter, alright buddy? I...I won’t harm you in any way,” I soothed, resting a gentle hand on his back. “You don’t have to be afraid. You don’t have to call the police. You don’t have to do anything. What you have is a choice. You don't know me but I’m not an awful person. I’ve just had a terrible week and I was going to do something god awful. I don’t have to though and quite frankly I don’t think I can. I just want forgiveness. Now, it’s up to you whether-”
            The clerk erupted to his feet, snatching the gun and sprinting out of sight, the squeals of his runners disappearing behind the constant drum of royalty-free music. I didn't even bother to look up. Instead, I pressed the pantyhose to my eyes and let my tears seep through the nylon. 
        Man, I suck at crime.

Instead, I found myself longing for the visceral details of my training in a fit of jealousy.
            President Krushchev had needed a General to oversee Vietcong supplyment and every General needs a Spetsnaz escort. Despite the 6,615 metric tonnes of unreasonably tough steel panelling that wrapped around our patrol boat's hull, there was little it could have done to compensate for the fueling miscalculation that left our crew bobbing in the middle of the Philippine Sea. General Yahontov’s status hadn’t been enough to warrant a search party, which meant that the only thing that had kept our crew of ten alive for the past year was our scattered memories of childhood fishing.
            On the edge of my peripheral, I could see another sunburnt comrade, the ship’s engineer, slapping at the water with the mustard yellow paddles of our red safety raft, probably heading out to reel in dinner. I resisted the urge to make eye contact. A fog of isolation had set over the crew, making human interaction feel superfluous. He disappeared around the corner of the boat as a seagull came cawing out of the sun, slipping through my crosshairs and soaring over the length of our vessel. 
                I jerked my torso left, pulling my weapon into alignment with the bird, and fired. My weapon spat a mangled shell into the apple crate between my legs as the bird came toppling down from the heavens and hit the water with a wet snap. I stared down at the crate in guilt, which was now teeming with casings stacked precariously on top of each other in a monument to my marksmanship.
                I had to stay accurate, for my country.
            I set down my firearm and began to run my greasy fingers over the bullet shell looped through the necklace draped around my blazing red neck. It had been a trophy kept by my grandfather from his time in the Russo-Japanese War. It was one of several relics passed on by the list of war heroes that cascaded down our family tree. I had known it was unlikely I would join their ranks. I had thought I wouldn’t even get to fight.
            Boredom decided otherwise.
            Boredom stalked every still moment on the ship, threatening to break me at each tick of the second hand. Hours tore away at my flesh, grappling at bits of my sanity as the sun stood stubbornly overhead, refusing to budge. I wanted to scream. I wanted something. But I hadn’t decided to serve for the action. I just wanted to help my country.
            I didn’t need action. 
            I began to tear at flaking bits of my sunburnt skin to reveal a crimson layer of new flesh when I caught a glimpse of a red safety raft, roughly 100 metres from where I was sitting, peaking its way around our ship. The way the sun caught the red sheen of the raft made it difficult to make out its passenger. I crumpled the edges of my eyes as I strained to identify their face, suspecting it was my comrade returning with his catch.
                It wasn’t though. I was sure it wasn’t. Something felt off.
                I swore I could make out a familiar emblem that had been pressed onto the scratchy blend of nylon and cotton that was their shirt. The tasteless combination of crimson red, sterile white and deep navy blue were unmistakable. It was an American flag.
                The enemy.
            My vision narrowed as I snatched my rifle and pushed its butt into my shoulder until I felt a profound and satisfying ache. I stroked my finger up and down the trigger as I swayed my crosshairs into alignment with the figure. I sucked in air until my ribcage pinched the flesh above my waist. I paused for a moment, letting my finger precariously hover over the trigger as I stirred in thought.
            An American floating, on a safety raft, in the middle of the Philippine Sea. I was wrong. But I didn’t want to be wrong. I just wanted something to happen. Anything.
            “I’m sorry,” I whispered as a tear began to sting my right eye.
                I pulled once on the trigger, letting a tidal wave of noise erupt from within the barrel and expand over the surface of the water, disappearing quicker than I had hoped. The figure collapse into a viscous pool of their blood and continued to gently float towards our boat until it made contact with a thud. I reluctantly leaned over the railing to get a glimpse of his face. The corpse was shirtless and sunburnt, clutching a fishing rod in one hand and a bright yellow paddle in the other. 
            I stepped back, tossing my weapon to the ground and sucking in vomit from erupting out of my mouth. I shook my head violently as I paced back and forth across the deck, letting the thunderous clanking of my metal toed boots drown out the drone of my thoughts. 
                I fell to the floor as crew members who had noticed the body began to swarm me, pointing their weapons at my chest as they shouted unintelligible obscenities. As I shut my eyes and let reality collapse into my imagination, their shouting melted into cheers then into an enthusiastic blend of war chants. Adrenaline shot, like electricity, through my veins.
             I wasn’t bored, I wasn’t crazy. I was their hero.

            `As my fingers weaved between the metal divots of the table, I occasionally looked up to find the captain’s eyes jumping back to the headline of his newspaper to try again. I certainly had an inch or two on him, but the sheen of his head and a pair of doughy eyebrows gave the impression of a man who was compact and coiled, like a rusty spring. Thunder tickled the shell of the B-52, generating the constant hum of warped metal and jumping screws that passed for white noise.
            A sudden flicker of light drove my pupils inward. As I struggled to grip the corners of a round table a cacophony of noise bludgeoned my eardrums. The captain’s right arm twitched, spreading a blanket of coffee that was tossed across the table and tucked into my lap.
                “Hey-oh, whoops. It’s all good,” I laughed, quickly reorienting the mug as my other hand swatted at the liquid before it could settle between cargo pockets. “You get a bit jumpy flying through a storm?”
                “I don’t think I jumped,” the captain remarked blankly, dragging the mug over the table’s corrugated steel before wringing the Folger’s from his newspaper.
                “What-ha, sure….that’s why you….what? You did.”
                “Nope. I tend not to get scared. Fear is how the Reds win.” 
                &emsp;I swallowed a chuckle as I reseated myself, absentmindedly fighting to share a knowing smile with the captain. “Okay, but the hot coffee. You just… So much hot coffee-”
                “Executive Officer?” A voice squeaked as a lengthy figure entered my peripheral.
                I turned to meet a slim faced lieutenant blinking furiously as he peered through the doorway leading to the cargo bay. He shifted his weight compulsively, shooting his tongue between his lips as he spat out a string of vowels and immediately sucked them back down.
                “Um… uh… um… the… um… the bay door was open.”
                I glanced over my shoulder at the captain to see a pair of furrowed brows crawl their way up his forehead as the paper slowly descended below his eyes.
                 “How many… uh… what do you call them?” I wondered aloud, twiddling my index in the air as if it could miraculously snag the right word. 
            “Is the bottom rotary slot empty?” the captain asked, his lips hardly breaking their seal.
            “Yes.”
            “How many H-bombs. That’s what it was! How many nukes are in the rotary?”
            “Three.”
            “There’s three now?”
            “Yes.”
            “That’s definitely how many we had. Did we have a fourth?”
            “I think we did-nope. We didn't. Or… no we didn’t. I think.”ggg
            We all carefully nodded our heads in unison, gaining speed and conviction as the bobbing continued. I shot a glance back at the captain, almost hoping to find my shock reciprocated; to see him fight to moisturize a sandpaper tongue. Instead, he sat entirely still, righteously unamused.
            Good. Good. Stay calm. Take control.
            “Right-Good-um… ”
                The array of dials and speakers that dotted the cabin wall suddenly sputtered to life, coughing static for a moment before finding their voice.
                “Mi-” The radio started before the fuzzy dribble ceased to exist, momentarily sucking the atmosphere from the room before the cabbin’s metallic hum rediscovered our eardrums.
                “Was that Mike?” I wonder, turning to the captain who had immediately begun  fiddling with the radio. “Our strike call is Mike-Alpha, right?” I pinched sweat off my palms as I took another jab at finding a human reaction in the captain. His eyes were icy and precise, darting systematically from knob to knob as he tuned new pitches of static.
                Find control. This is your job.
                “Fuckin’ storm,” he cursed, slicing his hand across the machine to send a final dial spinning before turning to face us.
                “When did you last see the bay doors closed?”
                “Maybe an hour ago, sir”
            The plane’s rattle seemed to grow louder prying away at the back of my skull and melting into my brain.
                Maybe it was inside my head.
                “Did we nuke?- um. Eddy, where would we have been over an hour ago!” I called out towards the cockpit.
                “Somewhere over Austria,” A voice echoed back.
             “Did we nuke Austria?”
                “Well, sir, I sure hope not,” the lieutenant choked with a dry laugh and a fleeting smile. “So, wait, are we at nuclear war?”
            “I mean, I guess-” I began, looking around as if the interior of the cabin might have changed, “I guess we are. Huh. Wait, are we good with Austria?” My tongue felt too soft for the words to catch air, instead they seemed to dangle flaccidly as they spilled out of my mouth.
            “What do you mean?”
            “Well would they be, you know, okay with being nuked?”OMG!
            “I mean…I can’t imagine they’d love it.”
                “Well they are close enough for the Reds to retaliate at least, right?”
            Control.
                “First, Let’s at least agree that we must’ve nuked Austria. Everybody is good with that.” Heads bobbed in unison. “Okay, good. Well not great. But good. Then, we need to-”
                “We need to reopen the bay doors. It's an alert program and we need to be on alert,” the captain directed with brash confidence, inserting himself between me and the lieutenant as he made his way to the cargo bay.
                Control.
            “Okay, if we do that then we should also prepare the incindiaries for drop,” I commanded, grabbing the captain’s shoulder and bringing him to a halt. “Can you do that?” The captain shrugged off my hand, shifting focus between me and the lieutenant. His shoulders cocked back, stiffening as he struck me with an unflinchingly deapan gaze.
            Dick.
            “Well, Executive Officer, if we are at war then I think it might actually be best that we take nuclear-” he began.
            “Yes, then we need to arm our warheads immediately,” I decided, slicing through his words with blistering decisiveness as I turned to the lieutenant. “We should be approaching Minsk, it’s a major city-”
            “I authorize nuclear action,” the captain snapped. 
            “Captain, let me just-”
            “I think it is best--”
            “Then I also authorize nuclear action,” I declared, throwing my palms upward in frustration. “Alright. Good. I have made my decision. Good. Lieutenant, we’ll just need clearance from a third party.”
            “Without ground contact we can’t be certain-”
            “Son, we may be the only alert plane-” the captain began. 
            “We… I think we're the same age.”
            “We may be the only alert plane within striking distance. We seem to have dropped a nuke and the ground has clearly tried to contact us. There must have been some kind of nuclear retaliation and we are the first line of defense.”
            “I just can’t. There’s no way to be sure. I mean what if we just had three nukes.” The lieutenant's eyelids flickered frantically, sweat convalescing at the tips of his eyelashes.
            “Then let’s flip a coin or something. Or I dunno, rock paper, scissors?”ggg
            “It can’t be random like that.”
            “Why don’t you and the captain just arm wrestle for it.”
            “Um… I don’t think that’s-”
            “It’s just. It’s time sensitive.”
            “Son, this is the best decision.”
                “Oh… I mean… I guess. Okay.” The lieutenant slumped into my chair and the newspaper was swept aside as the captain sat facing him. Both arms went up.
            Immediately the lieutenant’s came barreling down.
                “Huh… Okay, alright, good then. We’ll need verbal authorization,” I concluded, clapping my hands together and stroking my inner palms.
                “Wait…  but… hold on. I’m sorry, I don’t want to hold up this operation, but the captain's elbow was definitely not on the table.”
                “Please son, don’t be a sore loser.”
                “It was floating. Also, my cotton blend is all slippery and-”
                “I did not suspend my elbow. I just have a better upper body physique!”
                “The lieutenant is significantly taller.” I noted.ggg
                “So what? That doesn’t have anything to do with-”
                “I’m not authorizing anything, It’s a nuke!”
                “Okay, fine we’ll use the inciendiary option then!” I roared, sending a metallic sting throughout the cabin as I slammed my fist against the table. “We should be about five minutes out. Lieutenant, prepare the bread basket.”
                The lieutenant hurried back into the bay as I sat, propping my head back, emptying my lungs and stewing in the ambient rumble of the plane.  I had thought the storm might sound different now that we were at war.
            It didn’t.
